You type the popular pangram out, and that's it - the test is as simple as it gets. 

This is a personal project developed to work on my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills while being something that can actually be used and not be just a good looking static page. If you try the web-app out, I would love to [hear](mailto:vtube258@gmail.com?subject=Hey!) your thoughts!
